**Arcomage Classic** is a fan-made remaster of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcomage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arcomage</a> game, originally developed by <em>New World Computing</em> as part of the <em>Might and Magic</em> series. 

This project is my tribute to the original.

## Classic Remade with Extras

This remaster strives to be as close to the original as possible—sometimes even down to individual pixels. I probably spent more time tweaking tiny, barely noticeable things than was remotely reasonable (but hey, I love pixel art as much as pixel-perfect art).

While I’ve remained loyal to the source material, <strong>Arcomage Classic</strong> also includes a few extras for you to choose:

- <strong>Music</strong>: To enhance the atmosphere, I’ve added optional background music from the <strong>Might and Magic VIII</strong>.
- <strong>Accessibility Helpers</strong>: Optional features like resource indicators or generator icons can make the game easier to enjoy for more people.
- <strong>Improved Readability</strong>: By default, card texts use a more readable font, but you can toggle the <strong>Original Images</strong> option to relive the classic experience fully. The game also includes an option to lower the FPS to mimic the original’s feel.

## Why Arcomage?

I love old-school games and *Might and Magic* is one I played the most. I’ve always been drawn to the charm of retro gaming. A pure nostalgy, perhaps. Remasters that stay loyal to the originals hold a special place in my heart, and that’s precisely what I want to achieve with **Arcomage Classic**. From the visuals to the mechanics, my goal has been to make this remake feel like stepping into the tavern and picking up a deck in *Might and Magic VII* or *VIII*.

This project is the beginning of my personal journey into learning Unity and C#.

What I did create:

- **Programming and UI Design**: Everything you see in action, from animations to gameplay mechanics. I tried to replicate the original to the best of my abilities.
* **Custom Fonts**: I recreated two fonts from the original game.

What I did not create:

- **Game core** - I did not invent ideas of gameplay mechanics, rules, and all that stuff - this remains exactly as in the original game. I merely replicated it in the remaster.
- **Media** - All the **sounds** and (almost all) **images** are taken directly from the original **Arcomage**. I didn’t create those—they are the incredible work of the original *Might and Magic* developers.

I hope you will enjoy playing the game.
